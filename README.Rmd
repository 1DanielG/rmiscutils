This package will be a collection of simple R functions that I've either written or found over the years that I've found useful and like to re-use. I have just started working on it.


To install, you need to have the devtools package on your system (if you don't have it, install that with install.packages("devtools") ) and then run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("smach/rmiscutils.R")
```

To see a list of function and links to their help files, run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(package = "rmiscutils")
```
