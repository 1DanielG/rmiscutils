This package will be a collection of simple R functions that I've either written or discovered over the years that I've found useful and like to re-use. WARNING: I have just started working on it AND THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. THESE HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY TESTED FOR PRODUCTION USE BY ME, LET ALONE FOR ANYONE ELSE'S USE.

To install, you need to have the devtools package on your system (if you don't have it, install that with install.packages("devtools") ) and then run

``` r
devtools::install_github("smach/rmiscutils.R")
```

To see a list of function and links to their help files, run

``` r
help(package = "rmiscutils")
```
